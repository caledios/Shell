Shell
=====

This module contains custom-made Shell scripts, configurations, tools and
shortcuts.

Most of them are written for very specific purposes which usually revolves around
improving productivity, automating typical processes as much as possible, or 
providing live monitoring of items of interests.

Almost all aliases and functions are prefixed with a number, such as "1scanlog";
This is to make it easier to list all these personal aliases/functions from Shell's
autocomplete and set them apart from non-personal function calls that exist in the
system.

1's are aliases and function calls, e.g. 1scanlog, 1svndiff, 1scandb, 1flushlog.
2's are for moving locations, e.g. 2workspace, 2music, 2projects, 2projectsfive.

NOTE: some variable or function definitions will not be included here because they
contain company sensitive information. Therefore some functions or scripts will
need some adjustments before they are ready for use.
